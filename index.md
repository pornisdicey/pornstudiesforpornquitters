# Intro
I have been trying to quit pornography for 11 years now. It's easily the most prevalant, continuous issue in my life that I have faced for a long time. 
It objectively causes harm to 
* you
* the people around you
* your body
* the world

After all this time I'm at the point where my heart is under strain when I relapse due to the stress of doing it. Not necessarily guilt, just some deeply ingrained biological stuff going on. **ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. IT'S FUCKING BULLSHIT**

For at least 90 days I will spend 20 minutes a day looking over a study found on https://yourbrainonporn.com. I'm going to use expletives and profanity to get you riled up, because fuck this shit. You deserve better.
